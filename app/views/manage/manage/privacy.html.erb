<h3>Website and Mobile Users</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Mogade collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mogade's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mogade's visitors use its website and service. From time to time, Mogade may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>

<p>Mogade also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of users, or device id from mobile users. Mogade only discloses such information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Certain visitors to Mogade’s websites choose to interact with Mogade in ways that require Mogade to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mogade gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask developers who sign up to provide a username and email address.  Mogade collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Mogade. Mogade does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
<p>Mogade may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and who use its service. For instance, Mogade allows game developers to track the number of game plays per day as well as the number of new and unique users. Mogade may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Mogade does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Mogade discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mogade’s behalf or to provide services available at Mogade’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mogade’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Mogade will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mogade discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Mogade believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mogade, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Mogade website and have supplied your email address, Mogade may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mogade and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mogade takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mogade uses cookies to help Mogade identify and track visitors, their usage of Mogade website, and their website access preferences. Mogade visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mogade’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Mogade’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p>If Mogade, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that Mogade goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Mogade may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mogade may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mogade’s sole discretion. Mogade encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
